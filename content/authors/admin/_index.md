I am currently a MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Liverpool. Prior to this, I spent the summer of 2024 as an Operational Data Analyst at Unique Group where I gained invaluable experience and contributed to the optimisation of asset liquidations.

I earned by BSc Mathematics at the University of Aberdeen, where I modelled the MVP winner of the NBA in 2024.
